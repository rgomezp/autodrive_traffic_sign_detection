# Autodrive Traffic Sign Detection
## Team 2: 
- Rodrigo Gomez-Palacio
- Muhammad Ashfaq

Our program uses OpenCV to detect traffic signs within a stream. The algorithm works by first filtering the image/video based on color (red). Next, the algorithm detects shapes within the filtered image, highlighting the shape using a bright blue outline.
